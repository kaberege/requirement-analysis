# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the Requirement Analysis project. This repository contains a comprehensive breakdown of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. It aims to simulate real-world documentation practices used in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), helping learners develop clarity, precision, and technical writing skills essential for successful project planning and execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaboratively identify, document, and manage the needs and expectations of users and the business. It sets the foundation for the software project by ensuring all requirements are clearly understood and agreed upon before development begins.

This phase involves understanding **what** the system should do, **why** it is needed, and **how** it will be used. A well-executed requirement analysis reduces the risk of project failure, scope creep, and miscommunication between stakeholders.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Minimizes Errors and Rework**  
   Clear and detailed requirements prevent misunderstandings and reduce costly revisions during development.

2. **Aligns Stakeholders and Developers**  
   Establishes a shared understanding between clients, users, and the development team, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

3. **Enables Better Planning**  
   Accurate requirements support better estimation of timelines, resources, and project scope.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting high-level requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and brainstorming sessions.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Digging deeper into gathered information to clarify and refine requirements, often using techniques like use cases or user stories.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording the requirements in clear and structured formats such as Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents or markdown files.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Evaluating and organizing requirements to identify priorities, dependencies, and conflicts. Creating models or diagrams for better visualization.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are feasible within project constraints.


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the core features and functionalities of the system. For the **booking management system**, examples include:

- Users can create and manage bookings.
- Admin can view, edit, and cancel any reservation.
- System sends confirmation emails after successful booking.
- Users can view booking history.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe system attributes and quality factors. Examples for the same system:

- The system must be available 99.9% of the time.
- Response time for booking requests must not exceed 2 seconds.
- The application must be accessible via mobile and desktop.
- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.


## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help clarify what actions each user can perform, making them a vital tool in requirement analysis.

### Benefits:

- Clearly communicate functionality to stakeholders.
- Help identify missing or redundant features.
- Serve as a blueprint for designing user stories and test cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by the user or stakeholder. They ensure that features are implemented correctly and align with business needs.

### Importance:

- Prevent ambiguity by setting measurable goals for features.
- Serve as a basis for test cases and validation.
- Ensure mutual understanding between clients and developers.

### Example: Checkout Feature

**Feature**: Complete booking checkout

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Given a user has selected a booking slot, when they click “Confirm,” the system should process the payment and return a confirmation message.
- The confirmation must include booking details, payment ID, and date/time.
- If payment fails, the user should see an appropriate error message and the booking should not be created.
- All data entered must be stored securely and follow GDPR compliance.
